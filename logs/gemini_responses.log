[INFO] 2025-12-05 05:08:00 - A maximum-severity RCE (CVE-2025-55182, "React2shell") has been disclosed in React Server Components, impacting React 19 and Next.js (15.x, 16.x) due to insecure deserialization. This allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTTP request. Even applications not explicitly using Server Function endpoints are vulnerable if they support RSC. Immediate patching is critical. This underscores the subtle attack surface introduced by framework-level payload handling. How are teams approaching validation beyond traditional API endpoint scrutiny for RSC?
